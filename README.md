**Neighborhood Fix Map+** is a static, map-based civic awareness web project designed to visually represent common neighbourhood issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, garbage dumping, unsafe animal zones, and crime-sensitive areas.  
The project focuses on **improving civic awareness, safety, and accessibility** through a clean and intuitive interface built using **HTML and CSS**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban neighbourhoods often face recurring civic problems that remain unreported due to the lack of a centralized and user-friendly platform. Neighborhood Fix Map+ addresses this gap by offering a **visual, color-coded map-based solution** that helps citizens identify problem areas and understand neighbourhood risks at a glance.

This project is developed as part of an **Activity Based Assessment**, following the **Design Thinking methodology**.

- Provide a **city-level overview map** highlighting civic issues  
- Offer **neighbourhood-level maps** for detailed local insights  
- Categorize issues clearly using **color-coded markers**  
- Demonstrate a simple **“Report a Problem”** form (static)  
- Apply **Design Thinking principles** to a real-world civic problem  
- Build a clean UI using only **HTML & CSS**

## 🧠 Design Thinking Process

### 1️⃣ Empathize
- Studied daily challenges faced by citizens
- Identified safety concerns, lack of awareness, and reporting difficulties

### 2️⃣ Define
- Problem Statement:  
  > Citizens lack an easy, visual, and centralized platform to understand and report neighbourhood problems, leading to safety concerns and delayed responses.

### 3️⃣ Ideate
- Color-coded issue markers  
- Neighbourhood-wise maps  
- Issue clustering and severity indicators (conceptual)  

### 4️⃣ Prototype
- Low-fidelity: Paper sketches and wireframes  
- Medium-fidelity: HTML structure with basic styling  
- High-fidelity: Fully styled static web prototype  

### 5️⃣ Test
- User feedback collected on clarity, usability, and visual understanding  
- Improvements made to spacing, legends, and layout
